As someone new to the workforce, continuous learning is crucial. Describe a situation where you had to learn a new technology or skill to complete a task. How did you approach learning, and what resources did you use?

I joined Infosys as a fresher in September 2021. In the four months of my training, I was trained in Data and Analytics, specifically focusing on Spark, Big Data, and Data Warehousing After my training I joined Ulta cosmetics project in the Big data analytics domain where I am part of the Data Engineering team.
I have been working on the Ulta cosmetics project for the past 3 years. Initially, I was part of the SAP BODS Team, where I focused on data integration and transformation tasks. Afterward, I transitioned to the Azure Data Engineering team, that required me to work with Azure Cloud services, a technology I hadn’t yet explored in depth. The task involved setting up a  data pipeline using Azure data Factory and integrating it with Databricks for analytics. This was a critical part of the project, 
To approach learning this new technology, I started by breaking down the task into smaller components. I identified what I needed to learn about each Azure Cloud services like Azure data factory, Databricks, and the overall data pipeline architecture.
I then turned to mostly two resources to build my knowledge:
Firstly Online Courses where I enrolled in a few courses on platforms like Lex, Udemy and Microsoft Documentation. These courses offered hands-on labs and brief understanding.
Secondly the most Important one who guided me are My Colleagues and Mentors: I wasn’t shy about asking for help from my more experienced colleagues. I reached out to a mentor within the company who had experience with cloud, and we had a few one-on-one sessions where they walked me through some of the more complex aspects of the task.
